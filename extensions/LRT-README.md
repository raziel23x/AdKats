    </a>
</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    All 3500 infantry items in the game (primaries, sidearms, attachments for either, gadgets, grenades, etc) can be denied on spawn using this plugin, with customizable messages for each item. Settings allow for only enforcing loadouts on problem players, or for all players, with per-item gradation of that enforcement.
</p>
<h4>Basic</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Enforce every infantry item (any primary, secondary, attachments for either, gadgets, knifes, and grenades) in the game on-spawn.
    </li>
    <li>
        Any update made to the game's weapons are automatically imported and made available, so if DICE changes or adds weapons, they are immediately enforceable.
    </li>
    <li>
        Players notified and thanked when they fix their loadouts after being killed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Customizable kill messages for each denied item, with combined messages and details if more than one is spawned in the same loadout.
    </li>
    <li>
        Statistics on enforcement, including percent of players enforced, percent killed for enforcement, percent who fixed their loadouts after kill, and percent who quit the server without fixing their loadouts after kill.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>With AdKats</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Two levels of enforcement, allowing multiple levels of severity for each item.
    </li>
    <li>
        In-game commands to call more strict loadout enforcement on specific players.
    </li>
    <li>
        Using the reputation system, reputable players are optionally not forced to change their loadouts, as we know they are not going to use them.
    </li>
    <li>
        Admins are optionally whitelisted from spawn enforcement, but still fall under trigger enforcement if marked or punished.
    </li>
    <li>
        Other plugins can call loadout checks and enforcement, so it can enhance your current autoadmin.
    </li>
</ul>

    If you find any bugs, please inform me about them on the MyRCON forums and they will be fixed ASAP. Purchase of this plugin carries no guarantee to continue functioning properly if DICE changes their configuration to disallow this plugin's method of parsing loadouts.

        <b>Separated Layer IPs.</b> This is a battlelog intensive plugin, do not run it on more than one battlefield server from the same Procon layer IP address.

If you do not heed this warning, your layers run the risk of being temporarily IP banned from battlelog.

    <li>
        <b>Install the plugin. (With AdKats Installed)</b>
        Simple. You will be given an extension token on purchase, simply paste the token in AdKats setting "A14. External Command Settings | AdKatsLRT Extension Token". The plugin will be automatically downloaded and installed onto your procon instance. Restart procon to see the plugin.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Install the plugin. (WITHOUT AdKats Installed)</b>
        Once purchased, you will be given access to the private repository where AdKatsLRT is hosted. If you want future access for manual updates, supply a Github user name and you will be added that way. If you do not have a Github account, you will be given the source code manually.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Enable AdKatsLRT.</b>
        AdKatsLRT will start and fetch required information, then wait for the first player list response from either AdKats or the server. Once that comes through, it will complete startup and loadout enforcement will be online. Enjoy your new admin tool!
    </li>

<p>
    If you have any problems installing AdKatsLRT please let me know on the MyRCON forums and I'll respond promptly. All instances of AdKatsLRT are tracked once installed.

<h3>Item Library</h3>
<p>
    Every infantry item in the game (about 3500 items), can be enforced here. The settings are split into 3 sections; Weapons, Gadgets, and Weapon Accessories, in that order.
</p>

</p>
<h3>Loadout Processing</h3>
<h4>Deciding Enforcement Type</h4>
<p>
    <b>The gist of it: </b>Deny on trigger denies that weapon/accessory for problem players and players you've manually marked, deny on spawn denies that weapon for everyone except admins and repuatable players.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Details: </b>Loadouts have several reasons for being checked; A player spawns, gets reported, gets punished, gets marked, or has more than 5 infraction points. Any of these instances will call a loadout check, and the reason for checking them changes the way the enforcement works.
</p>
<p>
    When running loadout enforcement for a specific player, the reason, and action if invalid, is first decided. The following are results for specific reasons, in order of priority:
    <ul>
        <li>If a player was marked, they are set under trigger enforcement, and will be slain for invalid loadout of any kind.</li>
        <li>If a player is punished, they are set under trigger enforcement, and will be slain for invalid loadout of any kind.</li>
        <li>If a player was reported, their reputation is negative, and no admins are online, they are set under trigger enforcement and will be slain for invalid loadout of any kind. If they are slain after report, the report is automatically accepted.</li>
        <li>If a player has more than 5 infraction points, was punished in the last 2 months, their reputation is negative, and no admins are online, they are set under trigger enforcement and will be slain for invalid loadout.</li>
        <li>If a player joins, or spawns, has less than 15 reputation, and is not an admin, they are set under spawn enforcement, and will be slain for spawn denied items in their loadout.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h4>Informing and Acting</h4>
<p>
    If a player is about to be slain for loadout enforcement, regardless of enforcement type, they are shown two messages. The first is a generic message containing all denied weapons they have in their loadout "playername please remove [denied weapons] from your loadout". This messages is sent using player SAY. After that, the specific messages written by the admin for each denied item is displayed. These customizable messages are found in setting sections 5A and 5B, once denied items are selected. These messages are sent using player TELL.
</p>
<p>
    Immediately after informing the player of denied items in their loadout, they are admin killed. If they are under trigger enforcement, admins are notified of their demise, all other messages are private.
</p>
<p>
    Thank you messages are given to players who fix their loadouts. If a player is under trigger enforcement, admins are notified that they fixed their loadout.
</p>
<h3>Debug Messages</h3>
<p>
    Setting your debug level to at least 2 will display statistics in the console when stats change. The stats available are percent under loadout enforcement (should be nearly 100%), percent killed for loadout enforcement, percent who fixed their loadouts after kill, and percent who quit the server without fixing after being killed.
